What it does?
- convert pycam/heekscnc g-code files into reprap gcode (just tested with marlin-firmware for now).
  (Please let me know if it works with other CAM-Software)

Added features:
- Adding Feedrates for Traveling/Cutting/Z-Movements
- Added support for hudbrogs Visualisation in Octoprint / http://gcode.ws (https://github.com/hudbrog/gCodeViewer/)
- Added support for converting HeeksCNC G-Codes (Based on emc2b post processor)

Hope this is for some use
