PyCam (or other CNC) GCode to RepRap converter

What it does?
- convert pycam (or other cnc) g-code files into reprap gcode (just tested with marlin-firmware for now).

Added features:
- Adding Feedrates for Traveling/Cutting/Z-Movements
- Added support for hudbrogs Visualisation in Octoprint / http://gcode.ws (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:35248)

Hope this is for some use
